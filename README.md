How do I approach designing software?
  The designing of the software for this assignment was difficult when developing
  the meshes for each 3D object. I simplified this task by taking a 3D shape and
  only drawing it within its X and Y axis the making two more models for it while
  about its X and Z then the Y and Z axis. This allowed me to focus on one aspect
  of my code at a time. To ensure that the models were correct I allowed myself to
  implement multiple testing points and making adjustments as needed. For instance,
  when it came to rendering a cylinder, I would make an initial cylinder and adjust
  the width or height to have a better representation to the ratioed size of a battery.
  
How do I approach developing programs?
  Much like the designing of software the developing of the program was very iterative by
  making one aspect of the program at a time. During this project we started by just getting
  the window to load and testing if the window could be resized by using our code. Once the
  window was made, we created our first mesh to render a triangle and made modifications to
  it to change color and add a 3D facet to it. Eventually we got to our final scene that
  included shaders, textures, a light source, and multiple shapes.
 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Educationally and professionally computer science has taught me about breaking down large
  issues that are more manageable that the whole of a problem. By first just getting the
  window to work and testing multiple times that the window rendered I was confident that
  it was time to move onto the next problem to solve. I am also able to use my new ability
  of generating graphics by making realistic models of scenes that can give visual
  representation to an idea.
